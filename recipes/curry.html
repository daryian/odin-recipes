    <h2>Thai Chicken Curry with Coconut Milk</h2>
        <p>This is an easy Thai chicken curry that’s made in one skillet, ready in 20 minutes, and is naturally gluten-free. According to the computer-generated nutrition stats, there’s only 141 calories and 4 carbs per serving — no rice or naan included. With cold weather upon us, nothing is better than diving into a bowl of this hearty yet healthy comfort food that’s layered with flavors. I could just drink the coconut milk-based sauce.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tbsp. coconut oil</li>
            <li>1 large yellow onion</li>
            <li>1lb. boneless skinless diced chicken breast</li>
            <li>3 cloves minced garlic</li>
            <li>2 tsp. ground ginger</li>
            <li>1 can of coconut milk</li>
            <li>2 tsp. ground coriander</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded carrots</li>
            <li>1 tbsp. Thai red curry paste</li>
            <li>3 cups fresh spinach leaves</li>
            <li>1 tbsp. lime juice</li>
            <li>1 tbsp. brown sugar - optional</li>
            <li>1/4 fresh cilantro</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>rice, quinoa or naan - optional for serving</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To a large skillet, add the oil, onion, and sauté over medium-high heat until the onion begins to soften about 5 minutes; stir intermittently.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken and cook for about 5 minutes, or until chicken is done; flip and stir often to ensure even cooking.</li>
            <li>Add the garlic, ginger, coriander, and cook for about 1 minute, or until fragrant; stir frequently.</li>
            <li>Add the coconut milk, carrots, Thai curry paste, salt, pepper, and stir to combine. Reduce the heat to medium, and allow mixture to gently boil for about 5 minutes, or until liquid volume has reduced as much as desired and thickens slightly.</li>
            <li>Add the spinach, lime juice, and stir to combine. Cook until spinach has wilted and is tender, about 1 to 2 minutes. Taste and optionally add brown sugar, additional curry paste, salt, pepper, etc. to taste.</li>
            <li>Evenly sprinkle with the cilantro and serve immediately. Curry is best warm and fresh but will keep airtight in the fridge for up to 1 week.</li>
        </ol>
