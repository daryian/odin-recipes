The Recipe Project is part of The Odin Project. The main Idea is to 
create a database for recipes utilizing all the basic HTML knowledge we've 
learned so far. 

Upon completion of this project, this recipe collection will be a useful 
example of proper HTML structure and syntax. It will also showcase some important HTML fundamentals such as links, image embedding and lists.
